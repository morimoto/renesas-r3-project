=============================================

* What is this ? / Why needed ?

	[BACK GROUND]

	Renesas need to provide many kind of OS for customer for many reasons,
	and each OS needs device drivers for each devices, thus we need to create
	many drivers in total.

	And from customer point of view, each device driver for same device on each
	OS from Renesas should have same quality, but it never happened before.
	Because device driver developer have never synchronized each other.

	On the other hand, in some cases, customer received Linux BSP from Renesas,
	and try to use it as test purpose, but they will switch to there own OS after
	that for some reasons.
	In such case, customer want to re-use Linux driver to there own OS, but
	they can't, because of GPL license.

	[DEVICE DRIVER]

	Let's think about "device driver" here.
	"device driver" talks to both "OS" and "HW".

		<--- OS ---> <------------- device driver --------------> <--- HW --->

		Linux     <-> (talk to OS) device driver (talk to HW) <--|
		QNX       <-> (talk to OS) device driver (talk to HW) <--|
		FreeRTOS  <-> (talk to OS) device driver (talk to HW) <--|
		U-Boot    <-> (talk to OS) device driver (talk to HW) <--+-> SoC
		Xen       <-> (talk to OS) device driver (talk to HW) <--|
		Zephyr    <-> (talk to OS) device driver (talk to HW) <--|
		Integrity <-> (talk to OS) device driver (talk to HW) <--|

	If we can separate "talk to OS" and "talk to HW",
	it will be...

		<--- OS ---> <---------------- device driver -----------------><--- HW --->
		             <----- OS wrapper driver ------><-- raw driver -->

		Linux     <-> (talk to OS) device driver <--|
		QNX       <-> (talk to OS) device driver <--|
		FreeRTOS  <-> (talk to OS) device driver <--|
		U-Boot    <-> (talk to OS) device driver <--+--> common driver  <->  SoC
		Xen       <-> (talk to OS) device driver <--|    (talk to HW)
		Zephyr    <-> (talk to OS) device driver <--|
		Integrity <-> (talk to OS) device driver <--|

	[THIS IS R4]

	This is Renesas's recklessly project to separate "device driver" into
	"OS wrapper driver" and "raw driver" ;P

	"Renesas Reckless Register setting Reform Project", commonly known as
	"Renesas R3 Project" or more simply "R4 Project" !!
